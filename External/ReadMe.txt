This directory contains some (and hopefully soon, all) of the 3rd party dependencies.

It is provided to make it easier to download and compile everything.

However, if you already have all of these libraries then the contents of this directory are not needed.

If you choose to compile these libraries you will still need to set the corresponding environment variables in order to compile Helios.

This is done to support either method (i.e., using this directory or not).
